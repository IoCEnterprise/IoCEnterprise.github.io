This is a one-stop shop of information that will help you with your project work with us. Here you will find a mixture of information that will grow in time covering best practice, technical policies, and administrative advice on important aspects such as getting paid and what jobs are on offer. Who We Are & Contacts On a day to day level, you will have a technical mentor who you can go to if you are stuck with regards to the technical design and solution of your project work. This person will change depending on the project, but you will be told who this is going to be at the outset. That said, you will be encouraged to work on your own initiative, managing your own time, checking in with any team members or colleagues that you are working with regularly. There are several people behind the scenes who are supporting this enterprise programme from within the Computer Science department. For a day to day contact email iocenterprise@exeter.ac.uk Zoe Humble is the main contact with regards to the business account management, a useful liaison between yourself and the customer if needed. Zoe supports all aspects of administration around getting paid and other \u2018business\u2019 elements associated with the enterprise. What is on Offer The Institute of Coding (IOC) is a national organisation aimed at helping students gain skills and experience in programming and the IT industry. Exeter is working with the IOC, joining other Universities such as Aston, Cardiff, and Sheffield to set up \u2018coding hubs.\u2019 This initiative is however managed by Exeter and is for the students of Exeter who are undertaking computer science programming modules as part of their degree. The aim is to offer students paid work with clients on short-term projects. Projects will be matched against a skill set and experience. Currently, these jobs are found from clients within the University, in the future, we will expand the opportunity to include work with outside organisations. As you can imagine the University is a diverse environment and as such these projects could come from a number of sources, including, academic researchers who perhaps need an app coded to support a piece of data gathering or an education team who might need a solution to support an administrative or teaching activity. At the moment we are starting small, which is how most business start, hopefully through word of mouth, and as we move past the lock-down situation things will grow and we will gain more clients and offer more opportunities to students to gain project skills whilst earning some money. Our recruitment will depend on what jobs are on offer. Different jobs will require different technical skills, these will be listed in the role description.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#ioc-enterprise","text":"Welcome to the Institute of Coding University of Exeter GitHub page.

Then a short interview will be arranged with our temporary staff bank team within the University to validate your information. Register yourself on the casual claims system. Need to have an associate or casual claims staff IT account (not use your student account). The Student Enterprise Business Manager will help you get this. Provide your bank account details Provide your national insurance number if you have one. If you do not have a National Insurance Number you will be able to start work and get paid. Normally we would ask you to obtain a number from the Department of Work and Pensions, however due to the restrictions imposed by Covid-19 you will not be able to obtain one until further notice. In such an instance your enrollment onto the payroll will continue without this number. The chances are that you will not earn enough money within the year to pay national insurance.

For a payment to be made at the end of a month, the online timesheet must be completed and approved by the published payroll deadline (see Payroll deadlines ).

What We are Looking For We are looking for a number of things. Firstly, evidence that you have the technical skills to match what is needed to undertake the project work; details will be given in the job profile. You can demonstrate you have these skills by outlining any previous work you have done. This includes for example, work for another company, programming work you have done at home, a personal portfolio of work, hackathons, participation in clubs or societies, as well as of course, your University module results. Think broadly about your skills and experience, it is also important to have evidence of working in teams and have good communication skills. We do not need everyone to be the same, diversity is good in a team, so think what you can bring to the team, and consider what activities you have done at University and outside, that you would like to highlight. Consider Remote Working Working remotely brings its challenges so some of the skills that you need to demonstrate is enthusiasm and commitment to undertake the work throughout the project. You will be supported throughout the work, but mostly you will be working on your own. It is best to think carefully before you apply as to whether this type of work is going to be affected by any plans that you have over the coming weeks, personally consider whether you feel you might like the idea of working remotely. It is likely that the work will be Monday to Friday, 9 \u2013 5pm (with the usual breaks), as if you were self-employed or working in the office. When writing your application consider this aspect and discuss in your application how you have considered these challenges and how you can organise yourself to meet the challenge of remote working. In summary consider : Your technical skills against the job profile. How motivated you are to work on a remote working project. What your communication skills are, both written and verbal. Ability to write-up the necessary documentation that comes part of the development cycle. Being proactive and responsive with your communication whilst working as part of a remote team. Being able to demonstrate that you have worked on a project successfully on your CV will be to your advantage, as more and more employers have had to adopt this style of working due to Covid-19 . Selection Process The selection process is as you would expect for any job, we will ask you to fill in an application form, and also include a \u2018letter\u2019 by email outlining why you would like the role If successful you will be invited to attend an interview. Because we are at the moment working remotely the process will be a little unusual in that the interview will be conducted over Microsoft Teams . There will be a number of people on the panel. If you are situated in a different time zone to the UK we will take this into consideration and do our best to accommodate this.
